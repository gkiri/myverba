# Supabase DB Migration Documentation

## Prerequisites

- Supabase CLI installed
- Supabase project set up
- Node.js and npm installed
- https://orm.drizzle.team/learn/tutorials/drizzle-with-supabase
- supabse init ,login all CLI stuff do it in windows powershell

## Steps


### overview of what I did
1. prompt of entire frontend and backend syllabus managemnt prepared with D:\UPSC-AI\2024-weaviate\Verba-1.0.0\frontend\code-format-sql.md  and D:\UPSC-AI\2024-weaviate\Verba-1.0.0\frontend\database-create-migration.md
and  GS-1 table example with few chapters

2.as per https://orm.drizzle.team/learn/tutorials/drizzle-with-supabase , we copied app/db files an drizzle.config.ts.
cursor generated schema.ts and .sql file based on design

3.added DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL> from supabase

4.generated migrations with
 npx drizzle-kit generate

5.Run migrations:
npx drizzle-kit migrate

Task:


Background information about my vision:

I am developing an AI-based chatbot for UPSC students, but more customized for UPSC static and dynamic syllabus, more books. I will have a local database with all the UPSC books, chunkified for each chapter, so that I will have a specific pattern, like how we make the students learn, like providing each chapter. The chatbot will be provided with the entire roadmap, how to prepare, and so based on the roadmap, like let's say GS1, GS2, GS3, General Science 1 paper, it has history, geography, history will have again like 3-4 books. So, each chapter of the book I will maintain as one topic, like let's say for entire GS, I will have 100 topics, for GS2, I will have 200 topics, like that I will have a topology where GS1, under which they have to cover history, 100 topics, geography, 100 topics, like these topics, which are basically topic is nothing but one chapter. So, I will have this kind of a topology, so this is the roadmap I will use as. Also, chatbot will be given with this topology and with the topics names and the sub-topics names, so that at every query of a user, so basically AI is mentoring the student with the roadmap or topology. So, first you have to start with topic 1, then topic 2, like then once topic 1 is done, you would be given mock exams, like those are again the chapter 1 data is given to LLM and LLM will generate mocked exam and user will take the mock exam and if he makes any mistakes, wrong answers, those questions will be stored in the Superbase vector database, Supabase DB in cloud, which is Postgres DB, which is very famous Supabase. So, there I will store user specific, for example, chapter 1, under that I will store these mistakes he made, so that I will, so basically for every topic, I will maintain a separate table, so that I will maintain user specific, how confident he is in progress, is he completed the topic, how many marks he took, which are the weakness he has, based on the mistakes he did, all those things I will show in the dashboard. So, once topic 1 is done, you can move to topic 2 or even you can skip, let's say topic 1 you are bored, you can move to topic 10, for example, because you feel bored, so it's more like also like there will be like gamification, slight gamification related things like you entertain not to bore the student, and teach them in a very engaging way, so that like you make them students study more time, all these things. And so, for me, what are the suggestions, you would say, how should I maintain a display for the user, the roadmap, like let's say GS100, which is history geography 100, which there are 100 topics for history. So, how do I manage this, and also like I want to make sure like once he is done, like I have to take feedback from the user that he is very confident or like not confident, he is not at fear, like fully confident, like so that I can update the database that this topic is done, and I can move to next topic, or like I know the progress, you know. So, like this, can you suggest entire architecture, and basically I'm using front-end with Next.js and TypeScript, and back-end with Python, and weaviate vector database to store the data related to the chapters, and data store under cloud Postgres DB, Supabase DB, which is user management and authentication. So, let's improvise the architecture for more gamification, and also more user-friendly, and very, very productive, and it will be like a step function improvement for UPSC preparation.

I convert every uspc book in to json with each node has chapter name and its contents.so that I can use to fetch when I want. Also I want use the json data to show the overall roadmap and syllabus . Also assign ID for each chapter in supabase DB adnd maange user progress and thier data .simiary use json data to show syllabus tree and dashboard for syllabus progress
 @database-create-migration.md 
here is the json for one book look like

{
    "file_name": "India_after_independence_bipan_chandra.pdf",
    "metadata": [
        {
            "chapter_number": "1",
            "chapter_name": "India After Independence : Introduction",
            "subtopics": [],
            "pagenumber_start_end": "",
            "chapter_content": " ",
			"ch_id":"H1"
        },
        {
            "chapter_number": "2",
            "chapter_name": "The Colonial Legacy",
            "subtopics": [],
            "pagenumber_start_end": "",
            "chapter_content": " ",
			"ch_id":"H2"
        },
        {
            "chapter_number": "3",
            "chapter_name": "The National Movement and its Legacy",
            "subtopics": [],
            "pagenumber_start_end": "",
            "chapter_content": " ",
			"ch_id":"H3"
        },
    ]
} 
so create a table with name GS1 and each column names as chapter Ids here H1, H2  and I will customize according to number of books.
Please each chapter id I want to tract users progress ;like notstarted, in progress, completed , confident or whatever make sense.
under each chapter ID i want to track mock exam wrong questions as well and also want to track last time studied this topic and few more details.

please make all the table design simple , it easily extendabale , flexible , error proof, very high quality , production grade as I will 
be deploying in production this code for million of users

syllabus of GS1 management
GS-1 Table
{H1, H2 ,H3 } each chapter in History
{G1, G2, G3} each chapter in Geography

Now for each chapter I want to have its own fields which has user specific data to manage  like
a. status of study of that chapter .one vlaue out of {not started , in progress, complete}
b. last activity timestamp on this chapter
c. list of mock exam scores like [6/10 ,25/40 ,81/100]
d. list of questions that user did wrong


above 4 fields are per user data managed.
   
Implement supabase DB with  CRUD operations with drizzle. ORM .

Things already I have done:
1.supabase CLI insatlled in windows powershell
2.supabase auth is setup and done in code

feel free to comeup with nice design and vey high professional , error free 
please guide me in installation steps or any necessary dependencies and setup stuff for drizzle.
please implement al the necessary code needed for drizzle ORM.




Note: Dont disturb anything else.
Please go through the all code and carefully make necessary changes without breaking any code .
use thinking tags to think, analyse and plan and generate answer and generate solution carefully.


### 1. Initialize Supabase Project

If you haven't already, initialize your Supabase project:

```bash
supabase init
```
Note:start windows gui docker  and "supabase start" in windows powershell

### 2. Set Up Database Connection

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your database URL:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### 3. Create Migration Files

Use the Supabase CLI to create migration files:

```bash
supabase migration new create_todos_table
```

This will create a new SQL file in the `supabase/migrations` directory.

### 4. Write Migration SQL

Edit the newly created migration file. Here's an example of creating a `todos` table:

```sql:supabase/migrations/20240906123045_create_todos.sql
startLine: 1
endLine: 50
```

### 5. Apply Migrations

Run the migrations to apply changes to your database:

```bash
supabase db push
```

### 6. Generate TypeScript Types

After applying migrations, generate TypeScript types for your database schema:

```bash
supabase gen types typescript --local > types/supabase.ts
```

### 7. Update Supabase Client

Update your Supabase client to use the new types:

```typescript:utils/supabase/client.ts
startLine: 1
endLine: 8
```

### 8. Create Server-Side Supabase Client

For server-side operations, create a server-side Supabase client:

```typescript:utils/supabase/server.ts
startLine: 1
endLine: 37
```

### 9. Implement Database Operations

Now you can implement database operations using the Supabase client. For example:

```typescript:app/todos/actions.ts
startLine: 1
endLine: 73
```

### 10. Use in Components

Finally, use the database operations in your components:

```typescript:app/todos/page.tsx
startLine: 1
endLine: 31
```

## Additional Notes

- Always version control your migration files.
- Run `supabase db push` after adding new migrations to apply changes to your local development database.
- When deploying, Supabase will automatically apply any new migrations.

Remember to follow Supabase's best practices for database migrations and keep your local development environment in sync with your production database schema.
```

This documentation provides a concise overview of the Supabase DB migration process, including initialization, creating and applying migrations, generating types, and implementing database operations. It references the code snippets you provided and includes the necessary CLI commands.
